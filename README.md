Wine data analysis with Python jupiter notebook
Use the Wine dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality
1.⁠ ⁠Read the CSV files in Python 
2.⁠ ⁠Calculate the average ratings for all the red wines. Compare them with the white wines
3.⁠ ⁠Calculate the mean ratings for each of the features and the standard deviation 
4.⁠ ⁠Calculate the correlation and identify the features that have the highest correlation with the wine ratings
5.⁠ ⁠Calculate the number of high-quality wines (wines with a quality rating of >7) for both the red wines and white wines. 
6.⁠ ⁠Calculate the high-quality wine percentage i.e. the percent of the total wine samples having a high-quality rating (i.e. a quality rating of >7) for both the wine types (red and white wine) 
7.⁠ ⁠Perform comparative feature analysis of the high-quality wines i.e. how do the averages of all the features compare for high-quality wines (quality rating >7) against the low-quality wines (quality rating < 7) 
8.⁠ ⁠From the previous comparative feature analysis, identify the features with the highest percentage change between low-quality and high-quality wines.
